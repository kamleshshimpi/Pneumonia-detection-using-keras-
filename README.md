# Pneumonia-detection-using-keras-
Pneumonia detection using keras notebook

in this notebook I Used Convolutional Neural Network to detect Pneumonia in the X-ray image.

Performed Data augmentation and apply dropout and Normalizations to minimize the effect of over-fitting.

keras as main deep learning framework and used tensorflow in backend and Nvidia Tesla K80 gpu for better and faster computations.

link for the project notebook you can find below. thank you.
